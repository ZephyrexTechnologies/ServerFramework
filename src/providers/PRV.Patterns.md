# Providers
Providers are the method extensions use to connect to and standardize the interface of various services. Each extension comes with an abstract provider class that extends `AbstractProvider`. Providers each define a `name`, which is used to combine abstract provider types. For example, the `name: "Google"` provider might inherit from the base included `AbstractAIProvider`, but also `AbstractOAuthProvider`, `AbstractCalendarProvider` and `AbstractEMailProvider`, implementing the functionality of all 4 services into one provider. Providers are then connected to user accounts via a `ProviderInstance`. This allows multiple accounts of the same provider to be linked (for example multiple GMail accounts).

# Community Code of Conduct
## Commitment to a Safe and Inclusive Space
As participants, maintainers, and leaders within this community, we commit to fostering an environment where every individual feels safe, respected, and valued. Our goal is to ensure that all members — regardless of background, identity, or experience — can engage without fear of discrimination or harassment. This includes but is not limited to considerations of age, physical appearance, disability (visible or hidden), ethnicity, gender identity or expression, education level, socio-economic background, nationality, religious beliefs, race, sexual orientation, or any personal characteristics.
We are dedicated to nurturing a culture of openness, empathy, and mutual respect, promoting an atmosphere where collaboration and growth thrive.
## Expected Conduct
To maintain a welcoming and productive space, we encourage behaviors that strengthen our community, such as:
- Practicing kindness and compassion in all interactions
- Listening actively and respecting diverse perspectives
- Offering constructive, helpful, and courteous feedback
- Acknowledging and learning from our errors, and making amends where appropriate
- Prioritizing the well-being and success of the collective community above individual interests
## Prohibited Conduct
To preserve the integrity of our space, the following behaviors are strictly unacceptable:
- Use of sexualized or offensive language, imagery, or advances that are unwelcome
- Harassment, whether public or private, including deliberate intimidation or targeting of individuals
- Personal attacks, inflammatory remarks, or intentional provocation ("trolling")
- Disclosure of another person’s private details (e.g., address, email, or any personal data) without clear, explicit consent
- Any other behavior that could reasonably be considered unprofessional, hostile, or damaging to the community atmosphere
